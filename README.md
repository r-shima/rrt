# Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree
I implemented a 2D RRT algorithm in Python. This project consists of two parts: Simple RRT and RRT with Obstacles.

## Simple RRT
In the first part, I implemented an RRT in a two-dimensional domain, D = [0, 100] x [0, 100], with no obstacles. The program runs for 800 iterations. Below is a demonstration:

## RRT with Obstacles
In the second part, I implemented an RRT in a two dimensional domain, D = [0, 100] x [0, 100], with 40 circular obstacles. The program runs for 2000 iterations. Below is a demonstration:
